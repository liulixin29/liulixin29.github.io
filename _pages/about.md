I am currently a senior algorithm engineer at Alibaba Group, Beijing.

My current research interest lies in large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs). Previously, I worked on projects on a variety of fields, including natural language generation, vision and language, recommendation systems, and search engines.

Previously, I was a graduate student at Peking University advised by Prof. [Xiaojun Wan](https://wanxiaojun.github.io) and undergraduate student at Nanjing University.
